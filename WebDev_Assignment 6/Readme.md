## Q.1 What’s Constructor And Its Purpose?

- a constructor is a special method that is used for creating and initializing objects created from a class or a constructor function. It is typically defined within a class using the `constructor` keyword.

- The purpose of a constructor is to set up the initial state of an object and define its properties and behaviors. When an object is created using the `new` keyword, the constructor is automatically called, and it returns a new instance of the object.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", 25);
john.sayHello();
```

- the `Person` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `name` and `age`. Inside the constructor, the properties `name` and `age` of the newly created object are assigned using the `this` keyword.

- When the `new Person('John', 25)` statement is executed, a new instance of the `Person` class is created. The constructor is called with the provided arguments `'John'` and `25`, and the object `john` is initialized with the specified `name` and `age` values.

- The constructor is useful for performing any necessary setup or initialization tasks when creating an object. It allows you to ensure that the object starts with the correct initial state and that any required properties are properly assigned.

Constructors can also be defined using traditional constructor functions instead of the `class` syntax in JavaScript. For example:

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, This is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

const john = new Person("Nikhil", 24);
john.sayHello();
```

- In this case, `Person` is a constructor function, and the properties and methods are assigned to the object using the `this` keyword and the prototype chain.

## Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

The `this` keyword is a special keyword that refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value is determined dynamically at runtime based on how a function is invoked. The purpose of the `this` keyword is to provide access to the current object or context within a function.

The value of `this` depends on how a function is called:

1. `Global Scope`: In the global scope (outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object. In a browser environment, it typically refers to the `window` object.

2. `Object Method`: When a function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to the object on which the method is called. It allows the method to access and modify the object's properties and invoke other methods of the same object.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "John",
  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

obj.sayHello();
```

In this example, when `obj.sayHello()` is called, `this` refers to the `obj` object. Therefore, `this.name` accesses the `name` property of `obj`.

3. `Constructor Function`: When a function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created instance of the object. The constructor function is responsible for setting up the initial state of the object.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const john = new Person("John");
console.log(john.name);
```

In this example, `this.name` inside the `Person` constructor refers to the newly created instance `john`. The `name` property is assigned to `john`, and it can be accessed using `john.name`.

4. `Event Handlers`: When a function is used as an event handler, such as in response to a user action like a button click, `this` typically refers to the element that triggered the event. However, this behavior may vary depending on how the event handler is attached.

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", function () {
  console.log(this);
});
```

In this example, when the button is clicked, the function passed to `addEventListener` is executed, and `this` inside the function refers to the button element that triggered the event.

Note that the value of `this` can be explicitly set using methods like `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()`, which allow you to manually specify the context in which a function should be executed.

Understanding the `this` keyword and its purpose is crucial for working with object-oriented programming and handling different contexts within JavaScript functions.

## Q.3 What’s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them

- the `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods are used to manipulate the execution context (`this` value) of a function. They allow you to explicitly set the value of `this` and, in some cases, pass arguments to the function. While they serve a similar purpose, there are some differences between them:

1. `call()`: The `call` method is used to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments passed as comma-separated values. It accepts the `this` value as the first argument, followed by the function arguments.

```javascript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
}

const person = {
  name: "John",
};

greet.call(person, "Hello");
```

- In this example, `call(person, 'Hello')` invokes the `greet` function with `person` as the `this` value and `'Hello'` as the `message` argument.

2. `apply()`: The `apply` method is similar to `call`, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object instead of individual comma-separated values.

```javascript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
}

const person = {
  name: "John",
};

greet.apply(person, ["Hello"]);
```

- In this example, `apply(person, ['Hello'])` achieves the same result as the previous example using `call`, but the arguments are passed as an array.

3. `bind()`: The `bind` method returns a new function with the specified `this` value permanently bound, regardless of how the function is invoked in the future. It allows you to create a new function with a fixed context, which can be useful for event handlers or passing functions as arguments.

```javascript
function greet(message) {
  console.log(`${message}, ${this.name}`);
}

const person = {
  name: "John",
};

const greetPerson = greet.bind(person);
greetPerson("Hello");
```

- In this example, `bind(person)` creates a new function `greetPerson` where `this` is permanently bound to `person`. When `greetPerson('Hello')` is called, it prints the message with `person` as the context.

- The main difference between `call` and `apply` is how the function arguments are passed: `call` takes arguments individually, while `apply` takes them as an array. Both `call` and `apply` invoke the function immediately. On the other hand, `bind` returns a new function with the bound context, without invoking it right away.

## Q.4 Explain OOPS ?

OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects and data rather than just functions and logic. It provides a way to structure and design programs by encapsulating related data and behaviors into objects.

The core principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (properties) and related behaviors (methods) into a single unit called an object. An object encapsulates its internal state and exposes a set of methods to interact with and modify that state. Encapsulation helps in hiding implementation details and providing a clean interface for other code to interact with objects.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects, establishing a hierarchical relationship between them. Inheritance enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes or objects. A subclass can inherit properties and methods from a superclass and can also extend or override them as needed.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism means the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method or message in different ways. It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism promotes code flexibility and extensibility by enabling the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects.

4. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to focus on high-level concepts and models rather than dealing with low-level implementation specifics. Abstraction is achieved through classes, which act as blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties, and specifying their behaviors.

5. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information through methods and properties. Encapsulation ensures that object data is accessed and modified through well-defined interfaces, providing better security, maintainability, and control over data integrity.

## Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Abstraction in JavaScript refers to the concept of hiding unnecessary details and complexity of a system or object, and exposing only essential features or functionalities. It allows developers to work at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on the overall behavior and functionality rather than getting bogged down in implementation details. The purpose of abstraction is to simplify the code and make it more manageable, maintainable, and reusable.

1. `Encapsulation`: Encapsulation involves bundling data and related functions together into objects, and controlling access to the internal details of those objects. By exposing only a limited interface to interact with the object, encapsulation helps in hiding the implementation details and allows the object to be used without knowing how it works internally.

2. `Modularization`: Breaking down a complex system into smaller, independent modules is another way to achieve abstraction. Each module can represent a specific functionality or a set of related tasks, and the internal implementation details of each module can be hidden from other parts of the system. This way, developers can focus on building and maintaining individual modules without worrying about the complexities of the entire system.

3. `Abstract Classes and Interfaces`: JavaScript is a prototype-based language and does not have built-in support for abstract classes or interfaces like some other programming languages. However, abstraction can still be achieved by defining base classes or prototypes that define a common set of methods or properties, and then implementing specific subclasses or objects that inherit from the base class or prototype. By interacting with the base class or interface, developers can work with objects at a higher level of abstraction, without needing to know the specific implementation details of each subclass.

4. `Hiding Implementation Details`: Abstraction allows you to hide the internal implementation details of an object or a module. By exposing only the necessary methods and properties while hiding the underlying logic, you can create a simpler and more intuitive interface for other developers to use. This helps in reducing complexity and cognitive load, making the code easier to understand and work with.

5. `Separation of Concerns`: Abstraction helps in separating different concerns within a system. By breaking down a complex system into smaller, more manageable modules or objects, you can focus on implementing and maintaining each component independently. Each module can encapsulate a specific functionality and provide a clean interface for other parts of the system to interact with. This separation of concerns improves code organization, readability, and maintainability.

6. `Code Reusability`: Abstraction promotes code reusability by providing a higher level of abstraction. Once you have abstracted and encapsulated a module or an object, it becomes easier to reuse it in different parts of your codebase or in other projects. By abstracting common functionalities into reusable components, you can save development time and effort and maintain consistency across your codebase.

7. `Flexibility and Modifiability`: Abstraction allows for flexibility and modifiability in your code. By hiding implementation details behind an abstract interface, you can change the internal implementation without affecting the code that depends on the abstraction. This means you can modify or replace the underlying logic or implementation of a module or object without impacting the external code that uses it. This makes your code more adaptable to changing requirements and easier to maintain in the long run.

8. `Testing and Debugging`: Abstraction can also simplify testing and debugging processes. By abstracting complex systems into smaller, more manageable units, you can isolate and test individual components more easily. This improves the testability of your code and makes it simpler to identify and fix bugs or issues within specific modules without affecting the rest of the system.

## Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Polymorphism in JavaScript refers to the ability of an object to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context in which it is used. It allows different objects to be treated as instances of a common superclass or interface, even though they may have different specific implementations. The purpose of polymorphism is to enable code to be written in a more generic and flexible manner, allowing for greater code reuse and extensibility.

1. `Inheritance and Method Overriding`: By using inheritance, you can create a hierarchy of classes or prototypes, where derived classes inherit properties and methods from a base class. Polymorphism comes into play when a method defined in the base class is overridden in the derived class, providing a different implementation. This allows objects of the derived class to be used interchangeably with objects of the base class, invoking the appropriate method based on the actual object type at runtime.

2. `Duck Typing`: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that the type of an object is determined at runtime. In a duck typing approach, polymorphism is achieved by focusing on the presence of certain methods or properties rather than the actual type of the object. If an object supports the required methods or properties, it can be treated as a valid instance for a particular behavior or interface, regardless of its specific type.

3. `Interfaces and Abstract Classes`: Although JavaScript does not have built-in support for interfaces or abstract classes, you can still achieve polymorphism by defining and implementing interfaces or abstract classes using custom conventions or libraries. By adhering to a common interface, different objects can be used interchangeably, enabling polymorphic behavior.

The purpose of polymorphism is to write code that is more generic, flexible, and reusable. It allows you to design and implement systems that can work with a variety of different objects, without needing to know their specific types or implementations. This promotes code modularity, extensibility, and maintainability. Polymorphism enables you to write code that is agnostic to the specific objects it interacts with, reducing code duplication and making it easier to add new functionality or modify existing behavior by introducing new classes or objects that adhere to the same interface.

## Q.7 Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects or classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects or classes. It establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, where a subclass (also known as a derived class or child class) can inherit and extend the features of a superclass (also known as a base class or parent class).

The purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse, modularity, and extensibility. It allows you to define a base class with common properties and behaviors and create specialized subclasses that inherit those characteristics. Here are the key purposes and benefits of inheritance:

1. **Code Reusability**: Inheritance allows you to define and implement common features in a base class and reuse them in multiple subclasses. Instead of duplicating code, you can inherit the properties and methods from the base class, reducing code redundancy and promoting efficient code maintenance.

2. **Modularity and Organization**: Inheritance helps in organizing code by establishing a hierarchical structure. Related classes can be grouped together, with shared properties and behaviors placed in the base class. This modular approach improves code organization, readability, and maintenance.

3. **Extensibility**: Subclasses can extend the functionality of the base class by adding new properties and methods or overriding the inherited ones. This promotes flexibility and extensibility, allowing you to adapt and customize the behavior of subclasses while retaining the common features inherited from the base class.

4. **Polymorphism**: Inheritance plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables you to write code that can work with objects of various types, as long as they share a common interface or base class. This promotes flexibility and code reuse in scenarios where different objects need to be handled interchangeably.

example:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  eat() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is barking.`);
  }
}

const animal = new Animal("Animal");
animal.eat();

const dog = new Dog("rocky");
dog.eat();
dog.bark();
```

explaination :

- In this example, we have a base class Animal and a subclass Dog that extends Animal. The Animal class has a constructor that sets the name property and a method eat(). The Dog class inherits the name property and the eat() method from Animal and adds its own method bark().

- When we create instances of the classes, we can see that the subclass Dog inherits the properties and methods from the superclass Animal. The dog instance can access and invoke the eat() method inherited from Animal, as well as its own method bark().

## Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it ?

Encapsulation is an important concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that combines data (properties) and related behaviors (methods) into a single unit called an object. It aims to bundle data and methods together, protecting the internal state of an object from direct access and providing controlled access through a well-defined interface.

1. **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details and implementation of an object from the outside world. By encapsulating data within an object, access to that data is restricted to only the methods of the object. This prevents direct manipulation of the object's internal state, ensuring data integrity and protecting it from accidental or unauthorized modifications.

2. **Abstraction**: Encapsulation allows objects to present an abstracted and simplified interface to the outside world. The internal implementation details are hidden, and the object exposes only those methods that are necessary for interacting with and manipulating its data. This abstraction provides a clear separation between the external usage of an object and its internal implementation.

3. **Modularity and Maintainability**: Encapsulation promotes modular programming by encapsulating related data and behaviors into self-contained objects. Each object can be developed and maintained independently, making it easier to understand, modify, and test. Encapsulation also supports code reusability, as objects can be reused in different parts of an application without concern for their internal workings.

4. **Access Control**: Encapsulation allows you to control the access to an object's properties and methods. By defining appropriate access modifiers, such as public, private, or protected, you can specify the level of visibility and restrict access to certain members of an object. This enables you to enforce encapsulation rules and maintain proper data encapsulation.

By encapsulating data and behaviors within objects, encapsulation provides a way to manage complexity, improve code organization, and ensure data security in larger applications. It allows for better control over the interaction with objects and promotes a clear separation of concerns, leading to more modular, maintainable, and robust code.

## Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

the `class` keyword introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) provides a more structured and convenient syntax for defining and implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects that share common properties and behaviors. It serves as a template or a constructor for creating instances of objects with similar characteristics. The class defines the structure and behavior of objects, and from that class, you can create multiple instances (objects) that inherit those characteristics.

Here's an example of defining a class in JavaScript:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hi, I am  ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}
```

In this example, we define a `Person` class using the `class` keyword. The class has a constructor method that is called when creating new instances of the class. The constructor accepts `name` and `age` parameters and assigns them to the properties `this.name` and `this.age`.

The class also has a method `sayHello()` that can be invoked on instances of the class. This method logs a message to the console using the values of `name` and `age` from the instance.

To create an object (an instance) of the `Person` class, we use the `new` keyword:

```javascript
const Nikhil = new Person("Nikhil", 25);
```

In this case, `john` is an object created from the `Person` class, and the `constructor` is called with the provided arguments `'John'` and `25`. The `name` and `age` properties are assigned accordingly.

Once an object is created, you can access its properties and invoke its methods:

```javascript
console.log(Nikhil.name);
console.log(Nikhii.age);

john.sayHello();
```

## Q.10 What’s Super Keyword & What it does?

The `super` keyword is used to call and access the parent class's constructor and methods from within a subclass. It is typically used in the constructor of a subclass to invoke the constructor of the parent class and set up the inherited properties.

The `super` keyword has two main uses:

1. **Accessing the Parent Class's Constructor**: In a subclass, the `super()` method is used to call the constructor of the parent class. It initializes the inherited properties and sets up the parent class's state.

Here's an example:

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy", "Labrador");
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.breed);
```

In this example, the `Dog` class extends the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class has its own constructor, but it uses `super(name)` to call the `Animal` class's constructor and pass the `name` argument. This ensures that the `name` property is initialized correctly in the `Animal` class.

2. **Accessing the Parent Class's Methods**: The `super` keyword can also be used to access and invoke methods of the parent class from within a subclass. It allows you to override a method in the subclass while still having access to the parent class's implementation.

example:

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log("Animal speaks.");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    super.speak();
    console.log("Dog barks.");
  }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak();
```

In this example, both the `Animal` and `Dog` classes have a `speak()` method. By using `super.speak()`, the `Dog` class invokes the `speak()` method of the parent class (`Animal`), and then adds its own behavior. This way, you can extend and override methods from the parent class while still retaining the original behavior.
